# Qwen3-TTS → ONNX exporter

Turns a HuggingFace Qwen3-TTS checkpoint into the folder layout the
`Qwen3-TTS-Unity` package reads. Nothing here runs inside Unity.

## Environment

Needs the `qwen_tts` reference package, which is not on PyPI — these scripts
import its model classes directly to trace them. Everything else is in
`requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install git+https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS.git
```

Set `HF_HUB_DISABLE_XET=1` when downloading weights. Xet has hung on the
3.6 GB `model.safetensors` and left a corrupt header; plain
`huggingface-cli download` works.

## Exporting a checkpoint

```bash
python export_all.py \
    --model-id Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign \
    --output-dir ~/Downloads/Qwen3-TTS-ONNX/Qwen3-1.7B-VoiceDesign
```

Do the same with `Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base` for the cloning checkpoint.
Pass the parent folder to the package as its model root
(`QwenTtsSettings.ModelRoot`, handed to `QwenTts.Initialize`). Each checkpoint
is roughly 8 GB of graphs and tables (8.3 GB VoiceDesign, 8.7 GB Base, fp32)
and takes a few minutes; peak RSS while tracing is around 10 GB, so do not run
two at once.

`--skip <stage>` resumes a partial run. Stages: `embeddings`,
`speaker_encoder`, `tokenizer_encoder`, `talker`, `code_predictor`,
`vocoder`.

## Layout produced

```
talker.onnx[.data]            both phases; a zero-length past is a prefill
code_predictor.onnx[.data]
vocoder.onnx[.data]
speaker_encoder.onnx          Base only (x-vector for cloning)
tokenizer_encoder.onnx        Base only (reference audio → codes)
embeddings/*.npy              tables the C# reads directly, + config.json
embeddings/*_proj.npy         codec tables with the projection pre-applied
tokenizer/                    HF tokenizer files
```

## Files

| | |
|---|---|
| `export_all.py` | Orchestrator. Loads the checkpoint once, runs every stage. |
| `export_talker.py` | The 1.7B talker, one graph for prefill and decode. Self-checks all three shapes against torch and refuses to ship a mismatch. |
| `export_code_predictor.py` | Per-frame residual code predictor (15 groups). |
| `export_vocoder.py` | Codec decoder, variable frame count. |
| `export_speaker_encoder.py` | Mel → x-vector. |
| `export_tokenizer_encoder.py` | Reference waveform → codec codes. |
| `export_embeddings.py` | Dumps embedding / projection tables as `.npy`. |
| `mask_patch.py` | Replaces `transformers`' `create_causal_mask`, which uses `torch.vmap` and cannot be traced. Shape-generic, which is what lets one talker graph serve both phases. |
| `_onnx_util.py` | Collapses an export to one `.onnx` + one `.onnx.data`. |
| `bake_projected_tables.py` | Pre-applies the code-predictor projection to the codec embedding tables (~138 MB). Called by `export_embeddings.py`, and runnable against an existing export without reloading the checkpoint. |
| `quantize_int8.py` | int8 weights for the talker and code predictor, holding the output projection and outermost decoder layers in fp32. Optional; the engine uses them only when asked. |
| `pack_gdrive.py` | Copies only the runtime files (unified talker, no prefill/decode duplicates) into four store-only zips: fp32 VoiceDesign, fp32 Base, and an int8 overlay per checkpoint. `--only VoiceDesign` (etc.) writes one. Drive links for the published zips are in the package README. |
| `benchmark_precision.py` | Times fp32 against fp16 and int8 for one graph on your ONNX Runtime build, and reports how far the logits moved. |

## Reference implementations (debugging, not export)

Independent Python walks of the same graphs, for when C# output is suspect and
you need something with no Unity in it to diff against. Prompt geometry in
particular cannot be judged by listening — a wrong-but-plausible prompt just
makes a clone drift.

```bash
# VoiceDesign: instruct + text → wav
python generate_onnx.py --text "..." --instruct "Male, thirties, warm." \
    --model-dir ~/Downloads/Qwen3-TTS-ONNX/Qwen3-1.7B-VoiceDesign -o /tmp/out.wav

# Base clone: prints the prefill fingerprint LanguageModel logs to the console
python icl_prompt_ref.py --ref-wav <ref>.wav --ref-text "..." --text "..."
```

Reference audio handed to the tokenizer encoder is capped at 20 seconds
(`QwenTokenizerEncoderModel.GraphSeconds`); anything longer is truncated
before encoding.

## Gotchas

- **Do not re-export into a folder you have not cleaned** if you are on an
  older `_onnx_util.py`. `onnx.save_model` appends to an existing
  `.onnx.data` rather than truncating, which silently doubled the talker to
  10.5 GB. Fixed here by removing the destination first, but a stale copy of
  this script elsewhere still has the bug.
- **A talker exported before the graphs were unified** leaves
  `talker_prefill.onnx` and `talker_decode.onnx`. The C# still reads that
  pair, but it costs twice the memory; delete both after re-exporting.
- **Warnings from numpy matmul** (`divide by zero`, `invalid value`) on Apple
  Accelerate are spurious — verified NaN-free in and out. They are silenced in
  the reference scripts.
- **Do not reach for fp16 on the CPU execution provider.** Measured with
  `benchmark_precision.py` on ONNX Runtime 1.21: the code predictor goes from 1.88 ms
  to 30.72 ms per step, 17x *slower*, while being numerically near-perfect.
  There are no fast fp16 kernels for these ops on Apple silicon, so it casts
  and computes element-wise.
- **int8 is worth it, but not with every layer quantized.** Judge it by
  transcribing the audio, not by logit error: at 15% peak logit error the
  talker passed every numerical check and Whisper still dropped a phoneme from
  the test sentence (WER 0.125). `quantize_int8.py` holds the
  output projection and the first/last three decoder layers in fp32 by
  default, which halves the error and restores an exact transcript.
- **These scripts run to completion in the foreground.** Launched with
  `nohup ... &` from an agent shell they get killed with the session partway
  through, which looks exactly like an out-of-memory kill: no traceback, no
  output file.
- **`onnxconverter_common` 1.16.0 cannot convert these graphs** — its
  `remove_unnecessary_cast_node` throws `AttributeError`. Use
  `onnxruntime.transformers.float16`, which is a maintained fork.

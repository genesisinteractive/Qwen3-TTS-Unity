## ElBruno.QwenTTS

The ONNX inference path is derived from
[ElBruno.QwenTTS](https://github.com/elbruno/ElBruno.QwenTTS),

- `Runtime/Engine/LanguageModel.cs`
- `Runtime/Engine/EmbeddingStore.cs`
- `Runtime/Engine/TextTokenizer.cs`
- `Runtime/Audio/MelSpectrogram.cs`
- `Runtime/Internal/NpyReader.cs`, `Runtime/Internal/IOUtil.cs`

`TextTokenizer` is an in-repo GPT-2 byte-level BPE standing in for
`Microsoft.ML.Tokenizers`, which is not available to this Unity package. It
follows the same HuggingFace GPT-2 / Qwen2 tokenizer algorithm.

## Spark-TTS-Unity

The ONNX Runtime session infrastructure — `Runtime/Onnx/ORTModel.cs` and the
supporting helpers in `Runtime/Internal/` — comes from
[Spark-TTS-Unity](https://github.com/genesisinteractive/Spark-TTS-Unity)
(Apache-2.0), where this package's inference path was first developed. That
project's own Spark-TTS engine is not included here.

## Qwen3-TTS

Prompt construction, sampling defaults and the in-context cloning layout follow
Alibaba's [Qwen3-TTS](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3-TTS) reference
implementation (Apache-2.0).

The exported graph layout and inference order follow
[zukky/Qwen3-TTS-ONNX-DLL](https://huggingface.co/zukky/Qwen3-TTS-ONNX-DLL)
(Apache-2.0), itself derived from Qwen3-TTS.

Model weights are Alibaba's and are released under Apache-2.0; see the model
cards for the exact terms:

- [Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign)
- [Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base)

This package neither includes nor downloads them, and does not redistribute the
Windows `qwen3_tts_rust.dll` that project ships.
